    "comment": "Other than a Sept. 23 trip to Colorado, which is rematch of last year's Pac-12 title game, Washington isn't expected to face much resistance in the first half of the season. The Huskies are loaded with veteran stars at nearly every position, including  junior quarterback Jake Browning, a Heisman Trophy finalist last year, and senior linebacker Azeem Victor, a preseason All-American. Last season's run to the CFP semifinals was an unexpected surprise, but in reality fourth-year coach Chris Petersen built the roster expecting a return to national prominence in 2017.",

Anything can obviously happen, but the conference doesn't seem as deep at the moment and UW appears the class of the North and better than anyone else aside from USC.",

Stanford will be highly motivated to avenge last year’s 44-6 loss, and the fact the game will be played on The Farm makes it the most likely source of a blemish. A potential Pac-12 title matchup with USC looms as the potential game of the year not just in the conference, but in college football.",

I imagine they will do so again this season, and though Stanford on the road will be a significant test, UW should prevail to reach their second straight Pac-12 championship game. But that's where things will get dicey. By the end of the season last year, USC was the the best team in the conference and will be even better this year. Don't count on UW getting back to the playoffs despite having just one loss.",
