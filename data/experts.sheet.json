    "comment": "The Seahawks enter a new era with more questions than answers. Without Michael Bennett and Cliff Avril, will the team be able to generate a pass rush? Without Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor (and for the time being, Earl Thomas), is \"The Legion of Boom\" really dead? How will Russell Wilson and Co. adjust to first-year offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer? The truth is that this team isn't simply less experienced than the ones that recently dominated the NFC. It's less talented, too. The Seahawks will be fun to watch, but we won't be watching them in the playoffs.",

    "comment": "This is the most unpredictable Seahawks’ season in years, but what the heck, let’s predict it anyway. With the departures of so many key players, and the introduction of so many new players, the Seahawks could go any which way, but I see them going right down the middle to a .500 finish. As long as they have Russell Wilson at quarterback, they have a fighting chance to win every game. If the line coalesces and the running game develops, I will have undershot the mark.",

    "comment": "The Seahawks lost a lot of star power in the offseason but are not devoid of talent, with six Pro Bowl-level players on the roster (not including holdout safety Earl Thomas). Still, they have major question marks on both sides of the ball, especially with the running game and defensive line. It’s tough to see them returning to the postseason after a one-year absence.",

    "comment": "A tough schedule paired with a less-talented roster is not a recipe for success. Having a new offensive coordinator could be a good thing, but with apologies to Brian Schottenheimer, it’s more likely to be a dumpster fire. Maybe the Seahawks will surprise us with a winning record, or at least an 8-8 mark. But I’m not betting my rent money on it. That’s OK! It’s a rebuilding year — it happens, at some point, to most teams not run by a robot head coach in New England. I’m just hoping this season will still be somewhat interesting without Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor around.",

    "comment": "This is billed as a rebuilding year for the Seahawks, and that’s exactly what I think it will be. However, you’ve got to think that Russell Wilson’s presence in itself – albeit behind a still-shaky offensive line – is enough to at least get them six wins, right? Beyond Wilson’s magician moves, there are many questions at running back, on the defensive line and in the retooled secondary. All in all, I’m feeling a ceiling of 8 wins as a best-case scenario. They might get on the playoff bubble, but anything other than wild-card contention seems improbable.",
